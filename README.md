## Data Collection
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), containing air quality indices for various cities.

## Data Cleaning
In this step, we handle missing values and anomalies in the dataset.

## Data Exploration
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data distribution and identify patterns.

## Feature Engineering
New features are created to improve the predictive model.

## Data Modeling
Machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression are used to classify air quality levels. Models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualization
Interactive visualizations are created using Plotly to present findings. Geospatial data is used to visualize air quality across different cities.

## Deployment
The model is deployed using Flask to create a simple web application that predicts air quality levels based on user input.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder to follow the analysis steps.
4. To run the web application, navigate to the `app/` folder and execute `python app.py`.
